The objective of Full-Tank is to calculate exactly when and where you need to make a stop for gas so that you have one less thing on your mind and can fully enjoy that long road trip you've been thinking
about. This application utilizes the Microsoft Bing Maps API services to optimize a route, taking into account information about the user's car such as gas tank capacity, mileage, and percentage of remaining gas in tank. We've also built it using PhoneGap, allowing crossplatform compatibility so that no one ever has to get stuck with an empty tank out in the middle of nowhere!
